## Dynamic
{: .fs-9 }


The 'dynamic' method contains a function for allowing the contract to transfer your token and must be approved.

The section below shows an example of a possible transfer function:


```bash

```

This is only an example of the implementation, but can provides the default functionality needed for interoperability with existing Atomic NFT standards.
