<h2 class="fs-7 fw-500" id="arweave-makes-information-permanence-sustainable">Arweave makes information permanence sustainable.</h2>
<p><br />
Arweave is a new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever â€“ for the very first time.</p>

<p>As a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets, Arweave allows us to remember and preserve valuable information, apps, and history indefinitely. By preserving history, it prevents others from rewriting it.</p>

<h2 class="fs-7 fw-500" id="welcome-to-the-permaweb">Welcome to the permaweb.</h2>
<p><br />
On top of the Arweave network lives the permaweb: a global, community-owned web that anyone can contribute to or get paid to maintain.</p>

<p>The permaweb looks just like the normal web, but all of its content â€“ from images to full web apps â€“ is permanent, retrieved quickly, and decentralized â€“ forever. Just as the first web connected people over vast distances, the permaweb connects people over extremely long periods of time.</p>

<p>No more 404s. No more stealth edits. No more web apps that decline in quality.</p>
