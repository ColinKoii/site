<p>Atomic NFT is a standard for Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on Koii.</p>

<p>Anyone can utilize the Atomic NFT standard to tokenize and create digital assets and buy, sell &amp; auction assets utilizing the marketplace.</p>

<p>The Koii Network facilitates a range of services associated with Atomic NFTs by default, and most of these are commission-lite or commission-free. Because Atomic NFTs all follow a common standard, they are interchangable between all compatible applications, as well as bridges to other chains and formats like Ethereum (and EVM), Tezos, and Polkadot.</p>
